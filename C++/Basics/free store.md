# Free Store



Local variables go out of scope when the function ends

That's not always what you want 

The free store is for longer lived variables



The free store 

1. Create with new
2. Returns a pointer to the object or instance
3. Uses a constructor to initialize the object

* Tear down the delete
* Uses the destructor to clean up the object
