Command Line (CL)

CL Compliation

1. Preprocessor - Deals with `#include`, `#define`, etc directives
   1. for everything starting with a `#`
2. Compiler - Converts C++ source code into assembly
   1. `.cpp` to assembly
   2. this process is localised to each file
   3. outputs `.s` files
3. Assembler - Turns assembled code into object code (.o files)
   1. still no intercommunication between separate cpp files
4. Linker - Object files are linked together to make an executable program
   1. linker is the first place where files are combined



```bash
g++ main.cpp otherFile.cpp -o execFileName
```

`-std=c++14`: Enable C++14 support

`-g`: Add debugging information to the outpu

`-Wall`: Turn on most compiler warnings
