std::vector does not have a push_front function

3 1 4 5

0 3 1 4 5

Slow

真想要个很快的在头部插入该怎么办呢

`std::deque` has the exact same functions as `std::vector` but also has push_from and pop_front

```c++
std::deque<int> deq{5,6}; // {5, 6}
deq.push_front(3);				// {3, 5, 6}
deq.pop_back();						// {3, 5}
deq[-1] = -2;							// {3, -2}
```



size = number of elements in the vector

capacity = amount of space saved for the vector

不要觉得vector不好，因为indexed access 和向后插入是最常用的

:facepunch:

if possible, reserve before insert

What's the best way to create a vector of the first 1000000 integers?

```c++
std::vector<int> vec;
vec.reserve(1000000);
for (size_t i = 0; i < 1000000; ++i) {
  vec.push_back(i);
}
```

* Consider using shrink_to_fit if you don't need the memory
* Call empty(), rather than check if size() == 0
* Don't use `vector<bool>`("noble failed experiment")

It's easy to write inefﬁcient code.

Know about the common pitfalls - prevent as much resizing as much as possible.



##### What's a container adaptor?

Container adaptors provide a different interface for sequence containers. You can choose what the underlying container is
