# Chapter 2: Creating Services

## 2.1 Two types of objects



## 2.2 Inject dependencies and configuration values as constructor arguments



## 2.3 Inject what you need, not where you can get it from



## 2.4 All constructor arguments should be required



## 2.5 Only use constructor injection



## 2.6 There's no such thing as an optional dependency



## 2.7 Make all dependencies explicit

### Turn static dependencies into object dependencies



### Turn complicated functions into object dependencies



### Make system call explicit



## 2.8 Task-relevant data should be passed as method arguments instead of constructor arguments



## 2.9 Don't allow the behavior of a service to change after it has been instantiated



## 2.10 Do nothing inside a constructor, only assign properties



## 2.11 Throw an exception when an argument is invalid
