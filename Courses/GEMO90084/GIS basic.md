### What is GIS?



GIS is the abbreviation for geographic information systems



### GIS components

A GIS provides you with the tools needed to **solve spatial problems.** 

A GIS is made up of *five* components: **hardware**, **software**, **data**, **people**, and **workflows**. Each component contributes to the overall system that enables you to *make smarter decisions.* 



### Geographic information

Geographic information is made up of two types of information: **attribute** (or attributes) and **location**.



Attributes describe **nonlocation information**, such as ID numbers, names, and values.

Location describes where an object resides on the earth and includes x,y coordinates, addresses, and points of interest.



**Workflows** provides the plans and business rules unique to an organization.

## Why use GIS?

### GIS capabilities

#### Spatial analytics

Spatial analytics allow individuals to move beyond exploring the visual aspects of their data to using tools based on spatial algorithms to **identify trends, patterns, and relationships in data**.

e.g. A scientist uses spatial analytics to *monitor* the locations of an invasive plant species and to predict where this species may grow in the future.

#### Field operations

*Field operations* enable an organization's office staff and field workers to access the same authoritative data sources via mobile devices, reducing reliance on paper-based methods and **increasing productivity and efficiency**.



e.g. A utility worker in the field collects information about a water outage on a mobile device that is connected to a central work order system in the organization. As soon as the information is collected, repair crews can be dispatched immediately.



#### Mapping and visualization

Mapping and visualization allow individuals to view data from multiple sources, such as spreadsheets, databases, and live data feeds, on a map.



e.g. A package delivery driver views a list of delivery addresses on a map along with the optimal route for reaching each destination.



#### Real-time GIS

Real-time GIS monitors and displays data obtained from sensors or devices at specific locations, enabling individuals to make real-time decisions.

A dispatcher analyzes a map with current ambulance locations to dispatch the unit that is closest to a car accident.



#### 3D GIS



#### Imagery and remote sensing

Imagery and remote sensing provide tools and workflows that individuals can use to extract information from imagery and remotely sensed data.



e.g. A forester collects imagery of a forest area and extracts land cover classifications. The forester can then analyze this information to determine the vegetation types in that area.



#### Data collection and management

Data collection and management functions allow individuals to **access**, **use**, **integrate**, and **store business data** in a GIS.



### Web GIS benefits

Web GIS is a type of **distributed information system** made up of a GIS server and a client such as a web browser, desktop application, or mobile application. Web GIS connects users to maps, data, and tools.

Web GIS can benefit your organization in numerous ways. Here are five key **benefits**:

 

- Web GIS can be used by a broad audience, including public users who may know nothing about GIS. Web GIS is commonly designed for simplicity, intuition, and convenience.
- Web GIS allows everyone, no matter their location, to access geographic information, which helps improve collaboration among organizations, teams, and the public.
- Web GIS can be used by dozens or hundreds of users simultaneously, whereas a desktop GIS can only by used by one person at a time.
- Web GIS enables you to access data from various sources to meet your specific project needs.
- Web GIS can be applied at any scale, from an individual collecting data for a small project to multiple organizations collaborating together to develop a global solution.
