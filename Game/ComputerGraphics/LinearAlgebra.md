##### Q1

Q: What information does a vector encode?

A: Orientation and magnitude



##### Q2

Q: How do we actually measure these quantities?

A: magnitude. length or magnitude or norm

norm should capture how **big** the vector is

Try to write down each rule, draw picture to prove each rule.





#### Inner Product - Symmetry

<u, v>

norm measure length

==inner product== measures how well vectors "line up"
