Game design is primarily a process:

1. Incrementally modify the rules , changing very few things between each playtest.

   逐步修改规则，在每次测试后修改一些内容

2. Playtest the game with the new rules

   测试新规则

3. Analyze how the feel of the game is altered by the new rules

4. Design new rules that you think may move the feel of the game in the direction you want.

   按你想要的方向设计新规则

5. Repeat this process until you're happy with the game
