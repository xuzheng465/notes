# Introduction

That being said, while the patterns introduced here are useful in other software, I think they’re particularly well-suited to engineering challenges commonly encountered in games.

也就是说，虽然这里介绍的模式在其他软件中也很有用，但我认为它们特别适合于游戏中常见的工程挑战。

“I think they’re particularly well-suited to engineering challenges commonly encountered in games:”

* “Time and sequencing are often a core part of a game’s architecture. Things must happen in the right order and at the right time.

* Development cycles are highly compressed, and a number of programmers need to be able to rapidly build and iterate on a rich set of different behavior without stepping on each other’s toes or leaving footprints all over the codebase.

  开发周期是高度压缩的，一些程序员需要能够快速构建和迭代丰富的不同行为，而不至于互相踩踏，也不至于在代码库中留下满满的脚印。
