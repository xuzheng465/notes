Start method

Unity calls this method on the first frame where a script is enabled.

Since MonoBehaviour scripts are almost always attached to GameObjects in a scene, their attached scripts are enabled at the same time they are loaded when you hit Play.


Start() is primarily used to **set up variables** or perform **logic** that needs to happen before **Update()** runs for the first time.
