Security is economics



If you don't make it useable and secure, the users will make it usable but insecure.



Only as secure as the weakest link.



A door lock is only as strong as the window.



A **patch** is an update which is designed to remove such vulnerabilities.



An "0-day" is an exploit where nobody but the attacker knows about

â€‹	So there is no patch





There are no secure systems, only degrees of insecurity.
