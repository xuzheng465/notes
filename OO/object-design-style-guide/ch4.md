chapter 4: Manipulating objects



## 4.1 Entities: Identifiable objects that track changes and record events



## 4.2 Value objects: Replaceable, anonymous, and immutable values



## 4.3 Data transfer object: Simple objects with fewer design rules



## 4.4 Prefer immutable objects



## 4.5 A modifier on an immutable object should return a modified copy



## 4.6 On a mutable object, modifier methods should be command methods



## 4.7 On an immutable object, modifier methods sould have declarative names



## 4.8 Compare whole objects



## 4.9 When comparing immutable objects, assert equality, not sameness



## 4.10 Calling a modifier method should always result in a valid object



## 4.11 A modifier method should verify that the requested state change is valid.



## 4.12 Use internally recorded events to verify changes on mutable objects



## 4.13 Don't implement fluent interfaces on mutable objects
